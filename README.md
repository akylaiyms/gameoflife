## Implementation of John Conway's Game of Life 
by Ako and Roxy

- To run the simulation download all of the files from the repository in one directory. 
- When `gameoflife.py` is run the graphics window shows the input from the `testboard.txt` file
- You can adjust the global variables in `main()` function of `gameoflife.py` file to your taste. This will change the number of simulations to run, the size of graphics window, the cell size, and number of times you can draw the square before starting the simulation.
- After drawing the squares press any key to start the simulation. Press any key to close the graphics window once the simulation is complete.
